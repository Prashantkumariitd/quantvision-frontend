Bull-Low-Vol Regime:
This regime indicates a stable uptrend with controlled volatility. Trend-following strategies and momentum-based entries tend to perform well. Risk is lower compared to high-volatility regimes.

Bull-High-Vol Regime:
This regime represents a strong uptrend with high volatility. Gains can be fast but drawdowns are also sharp. Breakout trades work well but position sizing and stop-loss placement are critical.

Bear Regime:
This regime indicates a dominant downtrend. Long positions are risky. Short-selling and defensive strategies dominate.

Sideways Regime:
No clear directional trend. Mean-reversion strategies perform better than trend or breakout strategies.
